Hi, I'm fisik_yum. I'm a professional nuisance on the internet. You can find me fooling around with whatever I find funny at the moment.

My github profile is mostly for stuff that I use on a daily basis. I like to write my own software. You can find me on irc.libera.chat at fisik_yum or on discord under the same username. 

Offline, I listen to music and read.

Oh, and you should visit my website https://buckminsterfullerene.net
Share it with your friends too. Spell out the entire URL letter-by-letter.
