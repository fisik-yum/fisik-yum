HI!

I'm fisik_yum (or fisik if you want to keep it short) ! I write code for fun, mostly! I hope you find some of my projects to be of use to you.

Beyond  GitHub,  I can be found on:

Discord: fisik_yum#7560
YouTube: @fisik_yum
and whatever other links I list at https://fisik-yum.github.io/FS/CONTACT.html
I prefer communicating in English, but I'm bi(maybe tri?)lingual, so if you want to talk in another language that I know, I can do that too.

When I'm not on the internet, I'm probably sleeping, listening to music, or reading a book. I'm currently reading Between Two Fires.

I do not have a PGP key that I'm willing to distribute.
